			<p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
			<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</p>
		</article>

		<article class="content">
			<p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
			<p>I'm trying not to, kid. I find your lack of faith disturbing. He is here. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You think a princess and a guy like me-</p>

			<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>
			<p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. As you wish.</p>

			<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.</p>
			<p>There'll be no one to stop us this time! What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like...suicide.  Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. All right.</p>
			<p>Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
